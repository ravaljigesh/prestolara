You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers.<br /><br />Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them.<br /><br />Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.<br />Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities.<br /><br />Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?<br />That is also possible! You will therefore be able <strong>to offer a free product</strong> if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite!<br /><br /><strong>Integrated assistant</strong><br /><br />It isn't always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> has the solution to the problem.<br />When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock.<br />There is also an integrated <strong>dynamic price simulator</strong> for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business transaction, without you harming your profit margin.<br /><br /><strong>Remain the maestro of combinations</strong><br /><br />One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don't want to offer them all in this set?<br /><strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will allow you to do this.<br /><br />You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it's different to the one defined in your catalog.<br /><br />Your customers will then be able to <strong>personalise their selection</strong> amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer.<br /><br /><strong>Business Incentive</strong><br /><br />Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or <strong>spend more money per transaction</strong>.<br />Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?<br />All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!<br /><strong>Stop looking, you have already found the solution !</strong><br /><br />To entice your customers, <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack.<br /><br /><strong>3 possibilities are available: </strong><ul>	<li>Offer a specific discount on <strong>each product</strong> in the pack</li>	<li>Apply a general discount on <strong>the set of products</strong></li>	<li>Apply a <strong>fixed price</strong>, such as a psychological price, for example</li></ul><br /><strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.<br />This decision will be made even easier thanks to our <strong>clear and clean-looking interface</strong>, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily.<br /><br /><strong>You won't need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore</strong><br /><br />Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it's not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs!<br /><br />Once again <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> has the solution.<br /><br />By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.<br />Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack, <strong>the pack price will automatically be updated</strong>, and without you having to intervene.<br /><br />In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the <strong>promotional implications</strong>, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied.<br /><br />Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute <strong>respect for the legislation</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated!</strong><br /><br />For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be <strong>automatically deducted</strong>. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.<br />Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will <strong>automatically be displayed as unavailable</strong> for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern.<br /><br />For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack. <strong>There's no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock !</strong><br /><br /><strong>Highlight your packs and sell more</strong><br /><br />Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice, <strong>optimizing your SEO</strong>, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...<br /><br />For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing, <strong>Advanced Pack</strong> will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.<br />Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and <strong>able to finalise their purchase in one click</strong>.<br /><br />And that's not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be <strong>highlighted on their data sheets</strong> for those being sold in lots<br />This way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is <strong>cross-selling</strong>: an accessible method of <strong>increasing your average shopping cart</strong> !<br /><br /><strong>We don't forget designers</strong><br /><br />From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.<br />The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.5 and 1.6 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization.<br /><br />A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module, <strong>to facilitate the integration process</strong>. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the <strong>Advanced Pack 5</strong> engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.";s:3:"tab";s:13:"merchandizing";s:7:"version";s:5:"5.2.0";s:13:"compatibility";O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:4:"from";s:7:"1.6.1.0";s:2:"to";s:7:"1.7.2.2";}s:7:"nbRates";s:3:"136";s:12:"product_type";s:6:"module";s:7:"avgRate";s:3:"4.8";s:5:"price";O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:3:"EUR";d:249.990000000000009094947017729282379150390625;s:3:"USD";d:299.990000000000009094947017729282379150390625;s:3:"GBP";d:224.990000000000009094947017729282379150390625;}s:6:"badges";a:1:{i:0;O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"label";s:23:"Modules Partner Creator";s:3:"img";s:93:"https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png";}}s:5:"cover";O:8:"stdClass":2:{s:5:"small";s:91:"https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg";s:3:"big";s:90:"https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg";}s:6:"origin";s:9:"must-have";s:19:"origin_filter_value";i:2;s:14:"categoryParent";s:22:"Promotions & Marketing";s:17:"version_available";s:5:"5.2.0";s:11:"productType";s:6:"module";}s:17:"facebookpsshoptab";O:8:"stdClass":26:{s:2:"id";s:4:"1048";s:4:"name";s:17:"facebookpsshoptab";s:11:"displayName";s:31:"Shop Pro for THE Social Network";s:12:"categoryName";s:38:"Products on Facebook & Social Networks";s:10:"categoryId";s:3:"459";s:16:"categoryParentId";s:3:"455";s:11:"description";s:156:"Set up a "Shop" tab on your Facebook page and increase the number of visitors and potential buyers on your PrestaShop website.

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Minimum result price</div>

<div>- Maximum result price</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&quot;Apply only one condition&quot;).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>To apply and manage the discounts with our module, you have 3 options:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>- Very useful for the promotions season like <strong>Black Friday, Sales, Christmas, Cyber Monday</strong>, etc... to <strong>change the prices in the products with begin and end date activating and deactivating the offer automatically.</strong></div>

<div><strong>- You can set an increment in the catalog products only or a currency (or currencies) to avoid the currency conversion losses.</strong></div>

<div><strong>- </strong>Set a <strong>reduction for a VIP customers group </strong>offering them <strong>more competitives prices </strong>or set an<strong> increment to your Resellers group </strong>to get <strong>more benefits from the products.</strong></div>

<div><strong>- Change the prices in a Country or Zone and promote the sales in this geographical area.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><em>* The module doesn&#39;t change the original price of the product (you never will lose the original price).</em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Attributes filter (combinations)</strong></div>

<div>With the new attributes filter you can set the price changes only for an specific product combination.</div>

<div>Example: Modify the price only of your product with the L and XL size and not for the prices of the S and M size.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Features filter</strong></div>

<div>With the new features filter you can set the price changes only for products with an specific feature.</div>

<div>Example: Modify the price only for the cotton and synthetic products.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Quantity product units filter</strong></div>

<div>Added a new field to set the m&iacute;nimum quantity units of the product that must be in the cart to apply the change in the price.</div>

<div>Example: Modify the price of product from 3 units, then, the price of product will be changed automatically only if 3 or more products are added to the cart.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Change the prices within a period (date from and date to)</strong></div>

<div>Configure the price changes (increment, discount or fixed price) between 2 dates, or from a date or until a date. It&#39;s an optional field, is not necessary to set a date, if 0 there&#39;s no period limit to apply the rule.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) from 2016-10-20 until 2016-10-30</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) from 2016-10-20.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) until 2016-10-30.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>★ &iexcl;New! ★ -&gt; Threshold prices to apply the rules</strong></div>

<div>Apply the change in your prices only for the product which price is between a threshold.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) in the price of products which cost is more than 10&euro; and less than 30&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) in the price of products which cost is more than 50&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Apply the modification (increment, discount or fixed price) in the price of products which cost is less than 100&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Minimum result price = 100 and Maximum result price 200</div>

<div>If the result price after the rule application is below 100&euro; (89&euro; for example), the product price will be 100&euro;. If the result price after the rule application is above 200&euro; (205&euro; for example) the product price will be 200&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Minimum result price = 100 and Maximum result price 0</div>

<div>If the result price after the rule application is below 100&euro; (89&euro; for example), the product price will be 100&euro;. If the result price after the rule application is 105&euro; the product price will be 105&euro;.</div>

<div>Example: Minimum result price = 0 and Maximum result price 100</div>

<div>Feel free to play with a markup in the price of your products creating an increment or a reduction configuration by category, by product, by customer group, by customer, by country, by zone, by supplier and by manufacturer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Example: You can create a new category, associate the products to this category and with our module you could set all this category products to 20$ without changing the original product price and without creating complicated discount rules to obtain the desired price.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>No multistore needed for the same catalog products</strong></div>

<div>The customers group filter allows to avoid creating a multistore for a B2B and B2C store, sharing the same catalog products but with different prices in each.</div>

Pop Newsletter creates a popup inviting your visitors to sign up for your newsletter.<br />
With this professional and completely customisable pop-up, you can attract new subscribers and retain them with a discount on their next purchase.";s:21:"additionalDescription";s:1923:"Pop Newsletter allows you to show your visitors a pop-in when they arrive in your shop.<br />
Turn your visitors into subscribers!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Improve the subscription rate for your shop: </strong><br />
Pop-ins are effective at attracting visitors&rsquo; attention, gaining more clicks than sliders, banners or sign-up panels in the footer (which have a conversion rate of only 0.05%).<br />
The proven results for this tool show increases of between 20% and 1,000% in your subscription rate.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Turn your subscribers into loyal customers:</strong><br />
Offer them a discount voucher for their next purchase in your shop to thank them for subscribing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Offer a flawless user experience:</strong><br />
Similar to pop-ups but with an improved user experience, pop-ins integrate perfectly with the page where they appear.<br />
Pop Newsletter applies best practices recommended for this advertising method:
<ul>
	<li>Lightbox effect</li>
	<li>Option to close the module window with a simple click outside the pop-in, as well as a cross symbol button for closure in the top right-hand corner.</li>
	<li>Option to specify when the pop-in is activated. This allows your visitor to get to know your site before seeing the pop-in.</li>
	<li>Once your visitor closes the pop-in, it will not be shown again.</li>
	<li>Adaptable to all types of shop, with no need for programming or graphic design skills.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Improve results from your newsletters by increasing your contact base:</strong><br />

<div>Subscription-based e-commerce is an excellent way for brands and retailers to begin a process of getting to know their client&egrave;le and establish customer loyalty: <strong>the real strength of this economic system is simply its powerful ability to generate customer loyalty!</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Another advantage is that subscription-based e-commerce enables you to benefit from <strong>recurring monthly revenue without having to rely on the acquisition of new customers</strong>. What&#39;s more, subscription-based e-commerce encourages consumers to indulge and to re-purchase your products if they are impressed.</div>

<div>It stands to reason that there is no-one more loyal than a customer who pays a subscription, but be careful, there are a few down sides to the subscription nowadays: customers are developing an increasing dislike to being tied in. As a result you have to grant him a great deal of freedom; he must be able to cancel his subscription whenever he sees fit!&nbsp;</div>

<div>If at the beginning of the month your customer no longer wishes to receive the product or products for which he has subscribed, it should not have to be delivered nor billed for. Nevertheless, the likelihood that the customer will continue to use the service is much more important than is the case with &quot;traditional&quot; e-commerce! It is the assurance of regular monthly turnover, alongside the ability to manage your stock levels.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Our Advanced Subscription module for PrestaShop takes into account all of these precepts and saves you the precious time that would be required to implement them manually.</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The reason that the paid subscription model is developing so quickly within the area of e-commerce is that retail sites appear to find in it an effective solution by which to counteract one of the main issues that chips away at their profitability: delivery fees</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Amazon Premium, Fnac Express+, Cdiscount &agrave; volont&eacute;... Many e-commerce retailers are now launching their own paid subscription services. In order to grasp the reason behind the phenomenon, one need only remember the fact that delivery fees remain the leading cause of abandoned shopping carts and that, on average, a subscribing customer is twice as lucrative as a non-subscribing customer.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>A few figures to quantify the impact of delivery on e-business:</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>87% of online shoppers systematically search for a means by which to avoid having to pay shipping fees (searching for a promotional code, addition of a product to the cart...).</div>

<div>44% abandon their purchases purely and simply on account of these fees</div>

<div>66% switch to a different retail site in search of delivery conditions that are acceptable to them.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Converting customers into subscribers enables online retailers to save time and money compared to traditional methods of recovering customers and generating customer loyalty, as it allows you automate part of the customer relationship. This saving can then be allocated to a free delivery service reserved solely for your subscribers, thus eliminating this purchasing deterrent and in turn achieving much greater conversion rates.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Objective: to generate long-term customer loyalty</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>In addition to the appeal of novelty, subscription-based e-commerce represents a formidable double-edged sword for brands that are reliant on distribution networks and that are targeting growth. In actual fact, first and foremost the subscription principle allows retailers to generate recurrent turnover and a stable operating account.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thus, while subscription-based e-commerce may have cut its teeth with samples and travel-sized products, various other products now also appear to lend themselves to the model: in ready-to-wear clothing, cosmetics, culture and leisure, but also products intended for regular consumption such as mineral water or hygiene products (baby nappies for instance).</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Optimization of supply and of your logistics</strong></div>

<div>The subscription enables you to achieve an improved rate of re-purchase, thus allowing you to purchase from your suppliers more efficiently. In fact, our module will enable you to accurately predict which products will sell, in which quantity and at which frequency.&nbsp;</div>
