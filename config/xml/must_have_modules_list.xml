It is now possible thanks to Advanced Pack !  Without waiting any longer, you can create packs of products that can be purchased in one click, without worrying about stock or their combinations.  A precious additional sales tool  Accompany your customers in their buying process, by offering them packs of coherent products that you will have predefined, just as the salesman in a real shop would do. Such as for example: this fantastic camera, memory card and tripod. You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers.  Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them.  Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited. Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities.  Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack? That is also possible! You will therefore be able to offer a free product if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite!  Integrated assistant  It isn't always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again Advanced Pack has the solution to the problem. When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock. There is also an integrated dynamic price simulator for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business transaction, without you harming your profit margin.  Remain the maestro of combinations  One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don't want to offer them all in this set? Advanced Pack will allow you to do this.  You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it's different to the one defined in your catalog.  Your customers will then be able to personalise their selection amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer.  Business Incentive  Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or spend more money per transaction. Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers? All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost! Stop looking, you have already found the solution !  To entice your customers, Advanced Pack will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack.  3 possibilities are available: Offer a specific discount on each product in the packApply a general discount on the set of productsApply a fixed price, such as a psychological price, for example Advanced Pack will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack. This decision will be made even easier thanks to our clear and clean-looking interface, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily.  You won't need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore  Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it's not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs!  Once again Advanced Pack has the solution.  By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up. Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack, the pack price will automatically be updated, and without you having to intervene.  In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the promotional implications, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied.  Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute respect for the legislation.  Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated!  For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be automatically deducted. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities. Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will automatically be displayed as unavailable for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern.  For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack. There's no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock !  Highlight your packs and sell more  Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice, optimizing your SEO, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc...  For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing, Advanced Pack will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs. Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and able to finalise their purchase in one click.  And that's not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be highlighted on their data sheets for those being sold in lots This way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is cross-selling: an accessible method of increasing your average shopping cart !  We don't forget designers  From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator. The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.5 and 1.6 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization.  A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module, to facilitate the integration process. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the Advanced Pack 5 engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.2.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[249.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[299.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[224.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1048]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookpsshoptab]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Shop Pro for THE Social Network]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Products on Facebook & Social Networks]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Set up a "Shop" tab on your Facebook page and increase the number of visitors and potential buyers on your PrestaShop website.

Display a responsive and custom warning banner and disable cookies when users enter your website until you obtain their consent.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Our module fully complies with the European Cookie Law.  Complete compliance with the law  Besides displaying a warning banner, our module is the only one that allows you to block the cookies when users enter your store. As established by the law, you "shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent, having been provided with clear and comprehensive information."  Please note that all the other cookie modules sold on Addons only allows you to display a warning banner regardless of the user consent. Cookies are installed on the users' computer without obtaining their consent and regardless of their will.  Main features of the modulesDisplay a warning banner on every page to inform users about the use of cookies and ask for their consentDisable a list of modules when users enter the website because warning users about cookies is useless and illegal if you have already installed cookies on their computer.Enable these cookies after having obtained their consent or maintain them disabled if they refuse.Fully customize the warning banner (color, text, link, font, position, multilingual mode, transparency, buttons...) Getting the user consent   The module includes 2 different ways to ask user consent, you can choose between:Acceptance through a button: Users must click on the "I accept" button in the warning banner to give his consent. As soon as users give their consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules using cookies will get enabled and will work as usual. But if users refuse to give their consent, the disabled modules will remain disabled. We recommend you to use this mode, this one allows you to fully comply with the law.Acceptance through the navigation: If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. The warning banner is displayed on the first page on which users arrive with a message like « By continuing browsing the website, you accept the use of cookies ». As soon as users decide to go to another page, the banner automatically disappears and the disabled modules will get enabled.Note: the consent remains valid during the period of time set in the module interface (we recommend you not to go over 13 months)  Customizing the banner content and design  As recommended by the European authority, the module allows you to customize the warning message inside the banner (to inform users about the cookies users and their purpose) and add a "More information" button into the banner that take users to a CMS page of your store (to explain in details the use of cookies on your store).  The warning banner is responsive and will always be displayed full-width. The module comes with a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code, links...). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is multilingual and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language.  Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots crawl you store in order not to affect your SEO.

According to the rules you have chosen, you encourage customers to increase the value of their purchases in order to take advantage of free delivery.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Developing your sales by increasing the value of transactions has never been an easy thing to implement. The “Free Delivery Manager” module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of a rise in the amount of orders with total control of delivery costs.  The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.  The “Free Delivery Manager” module offers control of delivery costs by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to order more.  Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really control the impact of delivery costs. The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the “Free Delivery Manager” module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!  This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback. TimActive, in fact, grants great importance to your perception of our solutions and of the improvements that can be added. ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.6.4]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.2.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[89.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[109.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[79.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/691962-pprod/free-delivery-manager.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/691962-pbig/free-delivery-manager.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[8934]]></id><name><![CDATA[migrationpro]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[MigrationPro: Prestashop to Prestashop Migration Tool]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Data migration & Backup]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Upgrade PrestaShop or Migrating data between PrestaShops.MigrationPro is safe, easy and wicked fast automated module for upgrade PrestaShop and PrestaShop to PrestaShop migration tool]]></description><author><![CDATA[Community developer]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/data-migration-backup/8934-migrationpro-prestashop-to-prestashop-migration-tool.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/8934.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Upgrade PrestaShop or Migrating data between PrestaShops.MigrationPro is safe, easy and wicked fast automated module for upgrade PrestaShop and PrestaShop to PrestaShop migration tool.  ]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[What is it for? PrestaShop is one of the fast improvement eCommerce platforms at the current time and future.

Then create a discount coupon to obtain the shipping costs for free. Reminder1: Send the « Free shipping costs » email. Reminder2: Send the « Only a few days to benefit from the offer» email. ------------ Rule 2: For the new customers, create a 5% Off Your Order.

Reminder 2: Contact the customer by phone  My interest through Smart Cart Reminder module and the reminder rules: →  I increase my sales →  I control the cost of my marketing offers according to the cart →  I approach as close as possible to the desire of my customers →  I gain credibility by creating an intelligent and autonomous system which is no longer seen by my customers as an automatic emails or promotion distributor.   ** MANY KINDS OF REMINDER « STANDARD» or «MANUAL» ** Two kinds of reminders to adapt a little more to your reminder process:«Standard»: Sending an automatic email with a custom content of the cart to the customer.« Manual»: The module notifies you by email to communicate with the customer.You can even set the type of reminder that will suit your cart.   ** AN INTERFACE DEDICATED TO  « MANUAL » REMINDERS (PHONE) ** In one page, the module includes all the information of your customers; and includes many features dedicated for your manual reminders.

Think of how long it takes to receive an order from your customers, process the order by adding the products to the package, then connect to your shipping carrier`s software and manually insert the customer information, parcel information and delivery address for the order, for each order at a time. This is very time consuming and it`s very easy to make mistakes because you have a lot of data to process.  With this module all of this is done automatically via the API (Application Programming Interface) that connects the orders section in prestashop with the carrier and instantly sends the information to the carrier, then prints the shipping label which is then slicked to the package.

But with unprecedented targeting options that Google can only dream of: age, sex, family situation, exact geographical location, interests, groups, pages and products liked, and all the impressive data Facebook has on each and everyone of your customers and prospects. An online marketer’s dream come true ! And the cost is also typically lower than Google’s, giving you a much better Return On Investment.  Just Like Google, Facebook has also implemented a Custom Audiences and Remarketing platform, allowing you to display ads to people who have previously visited your online shop or blog, and segmenting them in any way you see fit. Or you can also acquire new customers that are similar to your existing customers based on the information Facebook has on them and comparing it with information they have on your existing customers.  This is all done via the Facebook Pixel code, which also serves to track orders / conversions on your PrestaShop online store.  When you mix the Facebook Product Catalog with the Facebook Pixel, you get Dynamic Product Ads: the ability to retarget visitors from your site with the exact products they have viewed or with complementary ones. Dynamic Remarketing is extremely effective and offers a very high conversion rate and ROI.  This all-in-one module provides everything you need to get started right now with the world’s newest, most advanced and effective online advertising technology on the market. So, get on board TODAY so you don’t miss the boat !  This module is developed and published by Business Tech, certified PrestaShop developer and winner of the 2011, 2014 and 2017 PrestaShop Awards for "Best module", with over 7 years of experience working with Google and Facebook.

Known mainly in box form, it is reaching and increasing number of sectors: ready-to-wear clothes, cosmetics, food products...]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Are you ready for subscription-based e-commerce?This is a business model that combines e-commerce and subscription retail. So what is the concept really all about?&nbsp;Subscription-based e-commerce is an excellent way for brands and retailers to begin a process of getting to know their client&egrave;le and establish customer loyalty: the real strength of this economic system is simply its powerful ability to generate customer loyalty!&nbsp;Another advantage is that subscription-based e-commerce enables you to benefit from recurring monthly revenue without having to rely on the acquisition of new customers. What&#39;s more, subscription-based e-commerce encourages consumers to indulge and to re-purchase your products if they are impressed.It stands to reason that there is no-one more loyal than a customer who pays a subscription, but be careful, there are a few down sides to the subscription nowadays: customers are developing an increasing dislike to being tied in. As a result you have to grant him a great deal of freedom; he must be able to cancel his subscription whenever he sees fit!&nbsp;If at the beginning of the month your customer no longer wishes to receive the product or products for which he has subscribed, it should not have to be delivered nor billed for. Nevertheless, the likelihood that the customer will continue to use the service is much more important than is the case with &quot;traditional&quot; e-commerce! It is the assurance of regular monthly turnover, alongside the ability to manage your stock levels.&nbsp;Our Advanced Subscription module for PrestaShop takes into account all of these precepts and saves you the precious time that would be required to implement them manually.&nbsp;The reason that the paid subscription model is developing so quickly within the area of e-commerce is that retail sites appear to find in it an effective solution by which to counteract one of the main issues that chips away at their profitability: delivery fees&nbsp;Amazon Premium, Fnac Express+, Cdiscount &agrave; volont&eacute;... Many e-commerce retailers are now launching their own paid subscription services. In order to grasp the reason behind the phenomenon, one need only remember the fact that delivery fees remain the leading cause of abandoned shopping carts and that, on average, a subscribing customer is twice as lucrative as a non-subscribing customer.&nbsp;A few figures to quantify the impact of delivery on e-business:&nbsp;87% of online shoppers systematically search for a means by which to avoid having to pay shipping fees (searching for a promotional code, addition of a product to the cart...).44% abandon their purchases purely and simply on account of these fees66% switch to a different retail site in search of delivery conditions that are acceptable to them.&nbsp;Converting customers into subscribers enables online retailers to save time and money compared to traditional methods of recovering customers and generating customer loyalty, as it allows you automate part of the customer relationship. This saving can then be allocated to a free delivery service reserved solely for your subscribers, thus eliminating this purchasing deterrent and in turn achieving much greater conversion rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Objective: to generate long-term customer loyalty&nbsp;In addition to the appeal of novelty, subscription-based e-commerce represents a formidable double-edged sword for brands that are reliant on distribution networks and that are targeting growth. In actual fact, first and foremost the subscription principle allows retailers to generate recurrent turnover and a stable operating account.&nbsp;Thus, while subscription-based e-commerce may have cut its teeth with samples and travel-sized products, various other products now also appear to lend themselves to the model: in ready-to-wear clothing, cosmetics, culture and leisure, but also products intended for regular consumption such as mineral water or hygiene products (baby nappies for instance).&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimization of supply and of your logisticsThe subscription enables you to achieve an improved rate of re-purchase, thus allowing you to purchase from your suppliers more efficiently. In fact, our module will enable you to accurately predict which products will sell, in which quantity and at which frequency.&nbsp;]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[pricing_promotion]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.3.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.9]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.2.2]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[499.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[599.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[449.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Best Module Loyalty"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/awards-loyalty.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/783025-pprod/advanced-subscription-with-automatic-recurring-payments.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/783025-pbig/advanced-subscription-with-automatic-recurring-payments.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[24399]]></id><name><![CDATA[dashbypayment]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Dashboard - Payment means]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Dashboards]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Boost your store&#39;s performance by adopting profitable payment means which perfectly fit your clients&rsquo; needs!
